    <p>
      A patch antenna is a type of antenna used for wifi and bluetooth
      applications, you will typically see them being used in the
      <em>1GHz to 10+ GHz</em> frequency range. They are PCB type antennas, so
      they require subtrate, ground and plenty optimization
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different ways to feed your patch antenna, it can be
      <mark>transmission line feeding, probe feeding, aperture feeding,</mark>
      etc. When designing patch antennas, you start out with equations for your
      dimensions based on operating frequency, substrate dielectric constant,
      substrate height, etc. The equations are never totally accurate, so tuning
      and optimization in whatever software youre using is required for you to
      meet your specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this document, I will walk you through my patch antenna design from
      single patch to arrays. For a single patch antenna, one can plug in
      certain information into an online tool to help with calculations, instead
      of doing the calculations by hand. In the <ins>appendix</ins> I have
      pasted a link to a well known patch and strip calculator (same one I
      used). Below is an example of one of the usages of the tool.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, I need to calculate the initial length and width of the patch and
      microstrip line since I am following this form of the Image shown below
      where the feed is a <em>50 ohm</em> strip line (connected to an SMA
      connector via soldering) followed by the <em>quarter-wave</em> strip line
      for matching the 50 ohm input to the impedance of the patch for maximum
      power transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially from an online calculator using the equations for patch antenna
      modelling, I have:
    </p>

      alt="Example of microstripline calculation"
    />
    <h5>Example of microstrip lin calculation</h5>
    <br />
    <p>My initial implementation in HFSS looks like:</p>

      src="Design pictures/HFSS single patch implementation.png"
      alt="HFSS single patch implementation"
    />
    <h5>HFSS single patch implementation</h5>
    <br />
    <p>
      I aimed for 2.45 GHz frequency of operation but I have a resonance of 2.47
      GHz in the image below. The Return loss is also around -19 dB, which is
      really good!
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, in antenna design, you want your return loss at the desired
      frequency to by -10dB or lower. This is to ensure that at least 90% of the
      power sent to the antenna is used to radiate the signal, meaning only 10%
      or less is reflected back to the source
    </p>

    <h5>HFSS single patch results</h5>
    <br />
    <p>
      Which is at around 2.47 MHz but with optimization, I can make it get
      centred at exactly 2.45GHz. Next, I explore antenna arrays for enhancement
      of gain and directivity.I came up with the same design in ADS where I
      have:
    </p>

    <h5>ADS single patch implementation</h5>
    <br />
    <p>and:</p>

      src="Design pictures/ADS single patch layout.png"
      alt="ADS single patch layout"
    />
    <h5>ADS single patch layout</h5>
    <br />
    <p>Next, I have the following results in ADS:</p>

      src="Design pictures/ADS single patch results.png"
      alt="ADS single patch results"
    />

    <h5>ADS single patch results</h5>
    <br />
    <p>
      I would say my EM simulation in ADS was more accurate than what I got in
      HFSS. I experimented with having the quarter wave matching network come
      first and the results were still the same.
    </p>

    <p class="title">Antenna Array theory and implementation</p>

    <p>
      Now you understand how single patch antennas work, we can move on to
      arrays. Next I try a 2x1 array in ADS where I start off with drawing out
      my plan, my plan shows the patch, transmission lines and the quarter-wave
      transmission lines. My drawing is:
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      When designing patch antenna arrays, you are simply doing continous
      impedance matching. One needs to understand what the impedance at the
      edges of the patch are so one can use online calculation tools to estimate
      the dimensions of the microstrip lines based on impedance, frequency and
      electrical length requirements
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like before where is used the online calculator to calculate the
      dimensions of the transmission lines with the assumption of a 180 degree
      phase shift for since there will be no change in the impedance seen at
      either end of the transmission line (impedance repeating). When there is
      an impedance repeat there is no mismatch in impedance from one end to
      another since impedances will be mirrored from one end to another. I also
      do the calculations with the calculator for the quarter wave sections, In
      the end all this is to ensure that the feed of 50 ohms Is constant
      regardles. My schematic implementation is:

    <img src="Design pictures/ADS 2X1 layout.png" alt="ADS 2X1 layout" />
    <h5>ADS 2X1 layout</h5>
    <br />
    <p>I have the results:</p>

    <h5>ADS 2x1 results</h5>
    <br />
    <h3 style="color: brown">2x2 Array implementation</h3>
    <p>
      Next with my same concepts I expand into a 2x2 array, again I ensure it
      all matches to a 50 ohms input feed. I have the following schematic
      design:
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Mind you I made the 100 ohm transmission lines at the very bottom
      dispersion to be longer (full lambda or 360 degrees) so that the 2nd and
      3rd patches don’t touch each other. I have the results of:
